<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Eliyah and I am a young aspiring web developer from Camp Springs,
  MD. I go to Hood College, a four-year college in Frederick, Maryland. I am a
  computer science major who initially decided to give software engineering a
  go, but could not find enough experience or land internships.

  I found muse in creating websites because I saw how interesting it was to
  learn more and more about how websites functioned and their anatomy. I am
  currently learning more about HTML but I am more excited to learn about CSS
  and JavaScript to make my websites look more complete and layered with more
  elements.
